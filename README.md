This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating a common off-by-one error in array iteration. The `bug.pl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from the incorrect use of `$#array` to determine the upper limit of the loop. The solution highlights the importance of carefully considering loop boundaries when working with arrays.
